As the frontend developer I'm supposed to:
- Make sure user interaction aspect of site is functional
- Communicate with DevOps
- Use languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

In order to achieve this I will test features before adding them, and this will allow me to make sure that all parts of the site will be functional for the user. And if were to not test these features there would be a chance that I implement a feature that either breaks the website or doesn't work which will lead to lower user satisfaction. In order to communicate with the DevOps I will message them daily about updates or things I need help with. I can also talk to them during class to keep them informed so they can help me as much as possible. And I will use frontend languages in making features more interactable for the user. Currently I'm using HTML to make the quiz, but the scripting for it will be done in JavaScript. And other QOL features will be done in HTML and CSS so the user can have a comfortable expirience when navigating the website.

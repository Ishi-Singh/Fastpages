## Pieces I Liked

The piece above was made by my friend and I find it interesting to look at since the colors go well together and the background looks really cool. This was done for AP Studio Art and there weren't many other pieces which had animals. Out of both of these pieces my favorite was probably the parrot since it stood out from the background and it also had better proportions than the deer. Not to mention the backgound was also better.

I liked this second piece because of its simplistic nature and how it potrays peacefulness. I also liked the slightly monochromatic color palette especially since it adds to how the piece looks. I also have a personal bias towards this since I like the ocean and other large bodies of water and the water was drawn well in this.

This piece is from ceramics and it's a turtle, I really like how the colors look since they go well together, especially since all of the color isn't blended out completely and has a marble effect. Not to mention the design is also really creative and overall the piece is really well made. This probably took a lot of effort to make since the handles had a braided texture and the turtle even had an expression.

This is the final piece that I liked in N@tM and it's a photograph, the main reason I like this is because of how saturated the colors are which makes them pop out and enhances the beauty of the piece. I also liked the right more since it has more contrast compared the the left one, and this contrast emphasizes certain details which adds to how the piece looks.

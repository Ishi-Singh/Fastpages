## Pieces I Liked

The piece above was made by my friend and I find it interesting to look at since the colors go well together and the background looks really cool. This was done for AP Studio Art and there weren't many other pieces which had animals. Out of both of these pieces my favorite was probably the parrot since it stood out from the background and it also had better proportions than the deer. Not to mention the backgound was also better.

I liked this second piece because of its simplistic nature and how it potrays peacefulness. I also liked the slightly monochromatic color palette especially since it adds to how the piece looks. I also have a personal bias towards this since I like the ocean and other large bodies of water.

This piece is frmo ceramics and it's a turtle, I really like how the colors look since they go well together. Not to mention the design is also really creative and overall the oiece is really well made.

## 3.14 Libraries

- Reuse code in order to make the process of writing the program faster
- Usually the procedure it too long to access, instead documentation is used
- Documentation is basically a description of what the program is and what it does
- It allows you to use the procedure without actually knowing the exact code in the procedure
- Makes coding more efficient
- APIs are basically documentations because they tell you how procedures in a library behave
- Libraries example: AP CSP Reference Sheet

## 3.15 Random Value

- Function: random (a, b) â†’ generates a random integer from a to b inclusive. Provides 1 number at a time. Each execution of a random number generator may produce a different result each time. 
- Ex. random(1, 5) could return 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

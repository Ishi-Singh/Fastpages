title: Big Idea 5 Hacks

## 5.1

1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

Three benefits and corresponding harms of computing are:

- Increasing efficancy at the expense of human jobs since people will probably lose their jobs to AI and computers
- Access to more information at the expense of some people not having access to this information
- Allowing for communication at the expense of dividing the world since not all people will have access to this communication the digital divide whould just be enhanced

2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

Many people especially high schoolers have dopamine issues and it's something many of them have expirienced including me. The issue I have is the lack of motivation especially when it comes to school work. Something that I'm doing to fix this is by giving myself rewards for completing tasks with a break. And that allows me to decrease the impact of my dopamine issues.

## 5.2

1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

As technology beocmes more prevalent in society things such as fake news, getting hacked, or phished become more common and the best way to combat that is through being informed. Things such as checking muliple sites for news and being suspicious of random links people tell you to follow can prevent such events having a negative impact on one's digital life. And having a safe and healthy place digitally can help someone empower themselves in the digital world.

2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

Empowered people should help those who are not empowered by supporting them thorugh their goals and helping them progress. This allows for the creation of a healthy and supportive environment similar to the one they made themselves when they weren't empowered. Something that can be done in Del Norte is by providing mentorship through clubs such as Peer Counselling or Link Crew which are aimed to help those in need.

3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

Paper and red tape limit digital empowerment since they slow down decision making it inefficienct to do things. However it's important to have necessary regulations in a digital environment to keep people protected. Digital safety is one of the most important things in the digital world and the only way to ensure privacy and security of information is by limiting paper or red tape.

## 5.3

1. Write summary/thoughts/conclusions from each of the exercises above. Focus on avoiding Bias in algorithms or code you write.

This section focused on how there can be a bias in computing especially if somehting such as AI is being used. The example shown was the HP computer video where the person stated that HP computers are racist. There are probably many reasons behind why the computer software didn't work but I believe it's because they didn't test the AI with people who have a different skin color making it not work once the product was launched. And such bias can be really harmful for a coumpany since it limits the number of customers they get and decreases user satisfaction.

## 5.4

1. CompSci has 150-ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?

 A crowdsource idea is an online forum where CSP students can communicate with other CSP students in other schools. How it would work is that students can post something (like code that isn't working) and other students can reply with ideas to either improve or fix the other student's code. This will allow for a creation of a healthy environment that will allow students to collaborate with each other across the nation and show what other classes are doing in their CSP. A Del Norte specific version could be done on slack with students utilizing the different channels to communicate their thoughts and difficulties.

2. What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing?

Crowdsourcing for Del Norte as a school can be done on social media since it's common for students to have it. Accounts such as dnhsasb can be used to spread polls and forms to get input and ideas from the students from our school. And our project can be better with crowdsourcing since it would allow us to know more about what the user wants from our website. Which would lead to a more innovated design for our site.

3. What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week.

Something we can capture at N@tM is user satisfaction with our services or how much our service actually helped them. This is similar to what my team did last trimester where we had a review portion for our project where people could give us a 1-5 rating on questions we ask about their experience. And this data can help us to improve or change our features so that it's more beneficial to those who need our service.

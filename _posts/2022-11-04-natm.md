## Overall Experience

I really enjoyed my experience at N@tM because there were so many pieces that were really inspiring to look at. Classes I went to inclues AP Studio Art, Ceramics, and Draw and Painting. Out of these my favority was probably Ceramics because there was a lot of diversity amoung the pieces that couldn't really be seen in the other classes.

## Pieces I Liked

From ceramics I liked this plate because of its high contrast colors which really made each component of the piece be enhanced.

From AP Studio Art there are hese two pieces which seem to be digital art.

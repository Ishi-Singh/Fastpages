- How a program is developed
  1. Investigation: understanding constraints and requirements of the program as well as its audience
  2. Designing the program: making a plan for how the program should look and how it must work
  3. Decide on program requirements: creating a prototype of the program with its specifications
  4. Testing: seeing if everything works as intended individually and throughout the whole program
  5. Refining and revising: making changes based on feedback, testing, and reflections

  2. Syntax error: an error casued by typos, missing code, or code that doesnt follow the rules of the language
  3. Run-time error: when a program fails when running

## Big Idea 1

### 1.1 Collaboration

- Increases diversity

  - Allows biases can be avoided
  - Ensures maximum people are happy with the finished product

- Connects the user and developers

  - Both parties know what to expect of each other
  - Feedback can be given to the developers to make their website better

### 1.2 Program Function and Purpose

- Computer innovations are created for a purpose and that purpose guides their developments
- Helps solve issues

### 1.3 Program Design and Development

- Programs starts with an idea and developers follow specific steps to do that
- How a program is developed
  1. Investigation: understanding constraints and requirements of the program as well as its audience
  2. Designing the program: making a plan for how the program should look and how it must work
  3. Decide on program requirements: creating a prototype of the program with its specifications
  4. Testing: seeing if everything works as intended individually and throughout the whole program
  5. Refining and revising: making changes based on feedback, testing, and reflections

### 1.4 Identifing and Correcting Errors

- Errors are common in a programming setting
- Three types of problems
  1. Logic error: a bug which causes code to run incorrectly
  2. Syntax error: an error casued by typos, missing code, or code that doesnt follow the rules of the language
  3. Run-time error: when a program fails when running
- Programs need ot be tested to ensure they are working as intended

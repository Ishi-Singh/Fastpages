## Brainstorming
- Individual ideas
   - Cat breeds
   - Video games
   - Music
- Literal approach
   - Need to make a quiz with partner
   - -> Make a partner quiz
      - Needs 2 people
      - Communication game

## Instructions
> Made by Ishi
1. 2 people must be playing this quiz together, Person A and Person B
2. Person B must have their screen hidden from Person A and vice versa
3. Each Person must take turns to DESCRIBE their image, they can't directly tell what it is
4. Both players need to answer before moving on to the next question

## Questions
> Made by Ekam
1. Person A has a giraffe on their screen
   Person B has a Toucan on theirs
  "What animal is on your partner's screen?"
2. Person A has the cover of the song "I Love It" by Icona Pop
   Person B has the cover of the song "Royals" Lorde
   "What song is shown on on your partner's screen?"
3. Person A has an image of various colored circles
   Person B has an image of differently colored circles
   "What is the color of the largest circle on your partner's screen?"

## Issues
We didn't hace any major issues when making this quiz, obviously we had difficulties using AppLab but that can be attributed to us just not being use to using block code. In general this was a really interesting activity, not to mention it was surprisingly informative becasue it taught how to structure code.

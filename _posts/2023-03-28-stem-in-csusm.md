## Notes

- People
  - Ashley: Majored in applied physics and is going to USD for a PhD in Material Science, she never let failures define herself, and likes CSUSM because it has a good support system
  - John: Majoring in Computer Science and believes that CS is versatile and can do many things with it
- History
  - CSUSM was made in 1989
  - It was a poultry farm before it became school
  - Its a national leader in social stability
  - Common to get internships with local businesses
- Classes and Clubs
  - There are many STEM classes offered like Chem, BioChem, ChemEdy, Physics, Bio, CS, Comp Info Systems, Cybersecurity, and Computer Engineering
  - Since it's a small college classes can be added more easily
  - A lot of clubs are STEM related like Cybersecurity Club, Robtics Club, 3D Printing, Women in STEM, Society if Women Engenieers, and Society of Physics Students
- Internships
  - To get internships you should join clubs, check emails, go to campus events, and use google
  - Tips → try to avoid unpaied internships, apply even if you feel underqualified, ask faculty members for hlep, go to writing center
  - Programs offered in CSUSM → Summer Scholars Program and the Quantum Bridge Program
  - There are many reserch oppertunites as well → Cancer Cell, Material, VR and AI, PerrorLab: Quantum information Science, Terrestrial Ecosystem Research lab
- Paying for College
  - Grant is government funded money and scholorship is private funded money
  - You should avoid getting loans
  - Subsidized loan: government helps to make sure you don’t go in debt
  - Un-subsidized loan: gets interest even when you’re in school
  - Apply to FAFSA (studentaid.gov)
- Other
  - Life after college: most students go to a teaching credential program, private industries, bio-med field, under-grad programs (paied to go to grad school)
  - Events → Cougar Blue Day: aimed for freshmen to get used to campus life

## Take Aways

Overall CSUSM seems like a really strong college for STEM since there are many STEM classes offered as well as many clubs that allow you to gain an interest in STEM. I really like how there are clubs like Robotics and Cybersecurity because both of them seem to be similar to FRC Robotics and Cyberpatriot which are both really interesting clubs. I also found the information about internships to be really helpful, as a high school junior I really need to be thinking about what I want to do in college. And if I go to a college which has such oppertunites it would be both fun and benificial. The tiny activity at the end was really enjoyable, however the changes that I would make to make the robot work better is by exposing more of the metal part of the wire to make it easier for it to connect to the battery.

I knew that the binary number 1101 was larger than 1011 but I didn't know what they were compared to decimal numbers. Binary 1011 is equal to decimal 11 and binary 1101 is equal to decimal 13. Making the order of the numbers in decimal 5, 11, 12, 13 and once converted back it becomes Decimal 5, binary 1011, decimal 12, binary 1101.

This question is asking about the list not the values in the list, the list elements are strings, the indices of a list are typically nonnegative integers.

The first two statements assign values to the variables, the third statement assigns the value of first to second, and the fourth statement assigns the value of second to first making both values true.

### 47

The values are assigned in the first five statements. The sixth statement assigns the value of x + b to b, the seventh statement assigns the value of x + 1 to a, the eighth statement assigns the value of c + d / 2 to d, and the last four statements display the values of a, b, c, d in that order making the answer 21 40 30 50.

## Problems I Found Difficult

### 10

I was debating between A and C for this question, but decided to go with A since it had information for ALL the students. This means that people in sports who had a GPA less than 3.5 could be compared as well.

For this question I was originally going to put A because I thought it was asking for which of the statements was false, but then I realized that two other answer choices were also false. But the answer this is D since it is the only trye statement

I wasn't completely sure how to solve this since I didn't know if the first number will go up by one as well or not. After seeing the answer I now know that only the second part increases.

In this question I just listed all of the binary numbers from 0-8 and noticed that it went up by x8. But I'm pretty sure we were supposed to do 2^3 to solve this since we are adding three zeros at the end.

This was done for AP Studio Art and there weren’t many other pieces which had animals. Out of both of these pieces my favorite was probably the parrot since it stood out from the background and it also had better proportions than the deer. Not to mention the backgound was also better. . I liked this second piece because of its simplistic nature and how it potrays peacefulness. I also liked the slightly monochromatic color palette especially since it adds to how the piece looks. I also have a personal bias towards this since I like the ocean and other large bodies of water. . This piece is frmo ceramics and it’s a turtle, I really like how the colors look since they go well together. Not to mention the design is also really creative and overall the oiece is really well made. .",

The answer is A since the value of input A is true which means the value from the OR gate is true, since the final outfut is true the value of input B didn’t affect the result . Question 12: . . The answer is B since both conditions don’t need to be satisfied in order for the elevator to work since the elevator needs to be on a different floor from which it’s called . Question 14: . . The answer is A since the output is true making it so that the input value of A must be true in order for that to occur . Question 15: . . The answer is D since it requires the robot to rotate left in order to reach the goal but it will rotate right since it comes before rotate left . Question 21: . . The answer is D since it’s an infinite loop since i is set to one every code is looped making it so that it never reaches i=4 . Question 27: . . The answer is D since it’s the only option that increases the distance the robot moves horizontally while keeping the vertical distance traveled the same . Question 30: . . The answer is B and C instead of C and D since the circles all have the same x-position of 4 and it’s only the y-position and radius changing . Question 32: . . The answer is C since program 1 the value of i starts at 1 and finishes at n so that result has the sum of all values from 1 to n while in program 2 the value of i starts at n and finishes at 1 so that result has the sum of all values from n to 1 which makes both o fthem have the correct sum . Question 33: . . The answer is C since in algorithm 1 the max value would be -1 and not change while in algorithm 2 the inital would have a max of -7 but change the max value in all cases returning the correct max value . Question 45: . . The answer is C since heuristic is any approach to problem solving that is practical but isn’t guaranteed to be optimal but is sufficient for reaching an immediate or short-term goal . Question 49: . . The answer is D since some problems, such as determining if any program will eventually stop, cannot be solved by an algorithm .",

Make sure user interaction aspect of site is functional | Communicate with DevOps | Use languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS | . In order to achieve this I will test features before adding them, and this will allow me to make sure that all parts of the site will be functional for the user. And if were to not test these features there would be a chance that I implement a feature that either breaks the website or doesn’t work which will lead to lower user satisfaction. In order to communicate with the DevOps I will message them daily about updates or things I need help with. I can also talk to them during class to keep them informed so they can help me as much as possible. And I will use frontend languages in making features more interactable for the user. Currently I’m using HTML to make the quiz, but the scripting for it will be done in JavaScript. And other QOL features will be done in HTML and CSS so the user can have a comfortable expirience when navigating the website. .",

            "content": "5.1 . Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing . Three benefits and corresponding harms of computing are: . Increasing efficancy at the expense of human jobs since people will probably lose their jobs to AI and computers | Access to more information at the expense of some people not having access to this information | Allowing for communication at the expense of dividing the world since not all people will have access to this communication the digital divide whould just be enhanced | . Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? . Many people especially high schoolers have dopamine issues and it’s something many of them have expirienced including me. The issue I have is the lack of motivation especially when it comes to school work. Something that I’m doing to fix this is by giving myself rewards for completing tasks with a break. And that allows me to decrease the impact of my dopamine issues. . 5.2 . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? . As technology beocmes more prevalent in society things such as fake news, getting hacked, or phished become more common and the best way to combat that is through being informed. Things such as checking muliple sites for news and being suspicious of random links people tell you to follow can prevent such events having a negative impact on one’s digital life. And having a safe and healthy place digitally can help someone empower themselves in the digital world. . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . Empowered people should help those who are not empowered by supporting them thorugh their goals and helping them progress. This allows for the creation of a healthy and supportive environment similar to the one they made themselves when they weren’t empowered. Something that can be done in Del Norte is by providing mentorship through clubs such as Peer Counselling or Link Crew which are aimed to help those in need. . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . Paper and red tape limit digital empowerment since they slow down decision making it inefficienct to do things. However it’s important to have necessary regulations in a digital environment to keep people protected. Digital safety is one of the most important things in the digital world and the only way to ensure privacy and security of information is by limiting paper or red tape. . 5.3 . Write summary/thoughts/conclusions from each of the exercises above. Focus on avoiding Bias in algorithms or code you write. . This section focused on how there can be a bias in computing especially if somehting such as AI is being used. The example shown was the HP computer video where the person stated that HP computers are racist. There are probably many reasons behind why the computer software didn’t work but I believe it’s because they didn’t test the AI with people who have a different skin color making it not work once the product was launched. And such bias can be really harmful for a coumpany since it limits the number of customers they get and decreases user satisfaction. . 5.4 . CompSci has 150-ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? . A crowdsource idea is an online forum where CSP students can communicate with other CSP students in other schools. How it would work is that students can post something (like code that isn’t working) and other students can reply with ideas to either improve or fix the other student’s code. This will allow for a creation of a healthy environment that will allow students to collaborate with each other across the nation and show what other classes are doing in their CSP. A Del Norte specific version could be done on slack with students utilizing the different channels to communicate their thoughts and difficulties. . What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? . Crowdsourcing for Del Norte as a school can be done on social media since it’s common for students to have it. Accounts such as dnhsasb can be used to spread polls and forms to get input and ideas from the students from our school. And our project can be better with crowdsourcing since it would allow us to know more about what the user wants from our website. Which would lead to a more innovated design for our site. . What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. . Something we can capture at N@tM is user satisfaction with our services or how much our service actually helped them. This is similar to what my team did last trimester where we had a review portion for our project where people could give us a 1-5 rating on questions we ask about their experience. And this data can help us to improve or change our features so that it’s more beneficial to those who need our service. . 5.5 . When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. . One License typw that can be seen on GitHub is the MIT License which is an open-source license that allows others to use, modify, and distribute code as long as they provide attribution. Another one is the GPL License which is also an open-source license that requires others to release the source code of their derivative works if they distribute the code. . In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic. . They talk about things such as licenses and how sometimes they are needed and as for legal and ethical thoughts are often about ethical considerations associated with the use and distribution of software and digital content, such as privacy, security, and intellectual property rights. . 5.6 . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. . PIIs that are mostly used in CSP are things such as names and emails since we use them to sign up into our Github accounts and Slack. And we don’t have to worry about thhings like our SSN or finantial passwords leaking since there isn’t anything that involves such transactions. . What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? . I would say that I have a constant exposure to PIIs since they are asked for everywhere whenever you want to sign-up for a website or whenever you go out to a store. And becasue of this I would say that I’m desensitized to putting in most of this information, and to some extent I also expect a pop-up which shows that we need to sign-in in order to use the service. . Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. . Typically a good password is considered to be one which is eight or more characters long, has both upper and undercase letter, and has numbers and symbols. You can make your password Pa$$w0rd since all of the above critirion are met but not 12345678 since it only fits having 8 or more characters and having numbers. Most bad passwords are those which can easily be guessed such as birthdays or “password.” However if a person has a password like that they still have a chance to be secure. This is through two-factor-authentication which gives the person a notification on code that needs to be used in order to use the other device. . Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. . In Symmetric encryption the encryption and decryption key is the same while in Asymmetric encryption the encryption and decryption key are different and that allows for more security since it stops unauthorized people from gaining access. . Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. . In AWS an exaple of encryption we can see is SSH encrytion when we are making an instance and have to make an SSH client which gives an unique key that can be used by us. . Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. . A phishing scheme I have learned about is the one where there is an email sent out to users saying that they have a debt that they need to give their credit card information and this causes the hacker to gain access to the bank account of the person and use it to do malacious things. .",

Hacks . The Big Picture purpose of this hack is to build a database. Being able to create an SQLite table and populate test data within it is the major goal. To do this effectively it is imperative to show the following. . Build Schema for a table, make a new model file and use users.py as an example. Start slow and simple and build up. | Build an initXXXXX() method and use it to add preliminary/test data to the table. Once again use users.py as an example. | Make a 30-60 second video where you show a Debugging session of making new rows in the table. Use sqlite marketplace tools and/or sqlite3 command line tool to show success in creating table and adding data. | Hack Helper . Here are some tips. . Become familiar with initUsers(). Observe it is called/activated from main.py. This function activates after you run the main.py and activate the web application in the browser. Observe that the sqlite.db file will appear in the volumes directory in conjunction with home screen of site appearing in browser. . | Delete sqlite.db from volumes directory on your development machine. Set breakpoint on initUsers() and run main.py using debug. Use the step into option on the debugger and observe the creation of data. . | . @app.before_first_request def activate_job():initJokes() initUsers() . Make your own XXXXX.py file under model directory. Follow users.py and develop your own schema from the OOP code you did in last Hacks. Follow the pattern in users.py to make a initXXXX() function top populate some test data. . | In main.py, add your initXXXX() method to def activate_job() function shown above. Use this as basis of your video debugging session. Debugging is hugely important at this level to understand your database success prior to building an API. Building initXXXX() method, adding database records, and debugging will enable you to verify CRUD operations as you develop. . | .",

This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

And she lives by the quote Maya Angelou “My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive”. In her presentation she emphasized how all companies want to use technology for the greater good of the people and do something the world wants, citing Qualcomm, Thermo Fisher Scientific, and HP Inc. as examples. . Kris Porter is a Software Engineer SRE DevOps and he went to UCLA for electrical engineering with a focus on communications. He’s done many things such as work for centers for Embedded Network Sensors and Networked Info Mechanical systems (NIMs). Not to mention he has a lot of experience since he’s worked in many places like Systems Engineer at Startup (GPM), NBC Universal (streaming media infrastructure in the 2012 olympics), Intro to DevOps at Qualcomm, Twitter (new datacenter deployment and migrating home timeline to graphql). And he is going to work at Mysten Labs. In his presentation he emphasized how he values continuous learning. And he shared things he’s learned like CCNA training, Machine Learning and Deep Learning (Qualcomm), Python (Udemy) and things he wants to learn like blockchains, AWS, and google cloud stuff. . QnA . Agile Methodology is different for each company and they all have different versions of it for their own purpos. Qualcomm uses roadmaps since there are many people working on project together and this allows for organization amoung many people. While Thermo Fisher Scientific uses short sprints to be able to do long projects. | When Kris Porter was learning Machine Learning in Qualcomm he learned how to use python libraries and other machine learning frameworks, NDS system, and how to use info (if people are downloading things) to archive and delete repositories since they cost money. | Machine learning in Thermo Fisher Scientific is used to predict where demand for products will be before products are made. | Skills that are considered the most important in the industry are: | . Continuous learning (continue to get better at your skill) and don’t be super concerned about things you read on the news, and there’s only risk if you’re not learning. . Being adaptive (best people are like this, listen to requirements and translates it to how tech can solve requirement) . Some of the biggest challenges they have faced include semiconductor industries going through acquisitions and interviews since it’s series of timed random test where you have to solve a problem in 30-45 mins | Having coding skills allows for a different way of thinking that increased critical thinking and problem solving skills a question that Kathyleen Beveridge likes to ask is “You’re in a room with no electronics you only have pen and paper how many cars did the US sell last year. And the main thing she wants to see is the way the person solves the problem and comes to a conclusion. | .",

            "content": "Bits: A bit or a binary digit, is the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store. A bit can be one of 2 physical states, such as either 0 or 1, yes or no, and true or false. . Bytes: A byte is a unit of data that is eight bits long. It is used by computers to represent a character such as a letter or number symbol. . Hexadecimal: Hexadecimal is a numbering system with base 16. There are 16 symbols or possible digit values from 0 to 9, followed by six alphabetic characters – A, B, C, D, E and F. It can be used to represent large numbers with fewer digits. . Nibbles . Binary Numbers: . Unsigned Integer: Numbers without + or - sign, only representing the magnitude not the direction. Used when we know that the value we are storing will always be non-negative Ex. 1, 2, 3, 4 . Signed Integer: The default where the variable can hold positive or negative numbers Ex. -1, 6, -29, 1000 . Floating Point: Positive or negative whole number with a decimal point. Used to represent real numbers and is written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts Ex. 1.23, 87.425, and -9039454.2, NOT 101, -3, 18203 . Binary Data Abstractions: . Boolean: Variable type that represents one of two values: True or False. A = 200 B = 33 If b &gt; a: print(“b is greater than a”) If a &gt; b: print(“a is greater than b”) . ASCII: Stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. ASCII was first created when all people wanted computers to be able to show was numbers, letters, punctuation, and non-printing commands(Enter, Delete, F1).. All ASCII encoded character can be represented by 1 byte, or 8 bits for a total of 2^8 = 127 different total characters. Ex. lowercase “h” character → 104 (D) → 01101000(B) . Unicode: today, people use emojis and new symbols like other languages and stuff and computers needed to be able to represent all that. Unicode is a new standard defining an association between characters and even more numbers. Each unicode character (utf8) is 4 bytes, or 32 bits, enough for 2^32 different characters. Most modern programming languages represent strings as utf8 encoded characters (hex) because people use these new symbols in their code, but old languages like C still associate either character type with a single byte integer Ex. “Hello” → U+0048 U+0065 U+006C U+006C U+006F . RGB: RGB (red, green, and blue) refers to a system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display.These 3 colors can be combined in various proportions to obtain any color in the visible spectrum. Ex. rgb(255, 0, 0) = red because red is set to its highest value (255), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 0. Data Compression . Lossy: a technique that reduces file size by discarding less important information . Lossless: Every bit of data originally in a file remains after it is uncompressed, and all the information is restored. . Variables: An abstraction inside a program that holds a specific value or meaning defined by the programmer. . Data Types: . Integer: highScore (involves math, save as integer or numbers) . String: firstName (name is text, so it is a string) . Boolean: isSunny (2 options, true or false) . String: phoneNumber (no math, just numbers) . Arithmetic Operators: Plus indicated addition (a + b) Minus indicates subtractions (a - b) Asterisk indicated multiplication (a * b) Slash indicated division (a / b) Managing Complexity with Variables . Lists: Allows you to complete a process for each value in the list, or store multiple values to one variable. . 2D Lists: Array within an array. You can pull single arrays through using index and variable commands. Ex: T = [[11, 12, 5, 2], [15, 6,10], [10, 8, 12, 5], [12,15,8,6]] . Dictionaries: Allows the storage or data keys and values (assigning a certain piece of data to fit the category it is assigned) . Class: A particular data structure. . Algorithms: An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, us as humans, do algorithms on a daily basis. . Sequence: A specific order a process is completed, which impacts the output. . Selection: Programmer decides between 2 different functions . Iteration: Repetition of a process . For loop: repeats a section of code a set number of times . While loop: repearts a section of code an unknown number of times, until the code is told to break . Expressions: A piece of syntax in coding . Comparison Operators: Operators used in programming languages which compare two different values. These can often be used to set up statements which return a boolean value (true/false), which can be stored in variables. All examples below are in Python and were checked using the bool() command, which returns the True/False output. . Operator: Function True output example False output example Notes == Checks if two values are equal to each other “Hrar” == “Hrar” 1 == 1.0 “Hrar” == “hrar” 1 == 2 If strings are compared, this is case-sensitive. Follows numerical equivalence if a float and integer is used. Cannot use leading zeros for integers/floats. != Checks if two values are not equal to each other “Hrar” != “hrar” 1 != 2 “Hrar” != “Hrar” 1 != 1.0 Similar to above. &lt; Checks if the left value is less than the right value 1 &lt; 2 “zz” &lt; “hi” 2 &lt; 1 “az” &lt; “hi” 2 &lt; 2 If strings are compared, the string appearing last in alphabetical order is considered less. float(‘NaN’) and decimal.Decimal(‘NaN’) will yield false regardless of what they are compared to. . Checks if the left value is greater than the right value 2 &gt; 1 “az” &gt; “hi” 1 &gt; 2 “zz” &gt; “hi” 2 &gt; 2 Similar to above &lt;= Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value 1 &lt;= 2 “zz” &lt;= “hi” 2 &lt;= 2 2 &lt;= 1 “az” &lt;= “hi” Similar to above = Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value 2 &gt;= 1 “az” &gt;= “hi” 2 &gt;= 2 1 &gt;= 2 “zz” &gt;= “hi” . Similar to above in/not in Checks if the specified value is an element in the specified list. in returns true if the element is in the list; not in returns true if the element is not in the list. . Example: List = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, “hi”] 1 in List 3 in List 5 in List “hi” in List “What” not in List “Why” not in List 2 in List 4 in List 6 in List 9 not in List 7 not in List “Weird” in List As usual, strings are case-sensitive. May be useful for conditional statements. . Booleans Expressions and Selection: The value of a boolean variable (True/False) can be used as conditions in selection (often known as if statements). The condition of the if statement is the boolean variable; if its value is True, the condition passes. A possible function of this is in Python code below . Grade = 89.49 isA = bool(Grade &gt;= 90) . if isA: print(“Yay!”) else: print(“hmm”) . OUTPUT: hmm . Booleans Expressions and Iteration: Certain forms of iteration (specifically while loops in Python) can use a boolean variable as a condition (similar to selection commands). As you may expect, the while loop executes commands until the value of the variable is false. In terms of a computer program, this could perhaps be used to execute commands critical for maintaining a certain process until that process is no longer needed. This could also potentially be used to periodically send notifications until a certain condition is met (ex: an assignment is submitted) Here’s some informal python code: num = 10 correct = bool(num &gt; 0) . while correct: print(num) num = num - 1 correct = bool(num &gt; 0) . OUTPUT: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 . Truth Tables: A table for a logical operator (ex: AND, OR, XOR) containing each variable and all possible input and output results of that operator. . AND TABLE: All inputs must be true to return output of true. . Input 1 Input 2 Output False False False False True False True False False True True True . OR TABLE: At least one input must be true to return output of true. . Input 1 Input 2 Output False False False False True True True False True True True True . XOR TABLE: Exactly one input must be true to return output of true. . Input 1 Input 2 Output False False False False True True True False True True True False . Characters: The units which make up a string. These can be letters, numbers, special symbols (!@#$%^&amp;*), or even spaces. Regardless, if one types, each keystroke outputs one character. Ex: “keyboard hi!!!” has 14 characters: 10 letters, three exclamation marks, and a space. . Strings: A variable data type which consists of a combination of letters, numbers, and other special characters (ex: @#$%^&amp;*). They are seen inside quotation marks, and operators cannot affect any numbers in the string. Ex: stringVar = “Hello World!” “Hello World!” is a string. . Length: The number of elements in a list. Here’s an example in Python: numList = [1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1] This list has a length of 17 because it has 17 elements. Each element is separated by a comma. . Concatenation: the act of joining two strings into a single string. Often, these strings are printed to an output terminal/console. Here’s an example in pseudocode: concat(“tri”, “llion”) This concatenates the strings “tri” and “llion”, making a new string “trillion”. Upper, Lower, Traversing Strings The first two (upper and lower) seem to be referring to Python methods. They are quite simple. I think it would be easiest to explain with a demonstration: . String = “WhYaReWeDoInGtHiS” . print(string) print(string.upper()) print(string.lower()) . Output: WhYaReWeDoInGtHiS WHYAREWEDOINGTHIS whyarewedoingthis . Relatively intuitive. The upper() method changes all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase, while the lower() method does the opposite. A potential reason for this would be ensuring uniform case (especially of uppercase when making important headings like page/screen titles) Traversing strings behaves highly similar to iterating elements in a list, except that instead of iterating through a list, it’s a string. Elements in a list are now the characters of a string. A potential application of this could be to search all strings for a specific substring. Here’s some example python code: . #Very informative example here: #https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterate-over-characters-of-a-string-in-python/ . String = “Thirty Trillion Dollars” . for i in String: if i == “T” print(“T detected!”) . Output: T detected! T detected! . Python If, Elif, Else conditionals: Python if statements execute associated lines of code if the if condition is satisfied. If the if condition is not satisfied, an Elif statement is executed as fallback… with another condition and associated commands If all associated Elif conditions are not satisfied, there can be an else statement which unconditionally executes associated commands. Ex: input = input(“enter a string”) if input == “Hi”: print(“Hello World!”) print(“How are you doing today?”) elif input == “Why”: print(“That’s a good question to ask about everything that happens.”) elif input == “Who are you”: print(“I’m an anonymous guest. Pleased to meet you.”) else: print(“Have a great day!”) . This code uses if statements and elif statements to return strings for three special inputs (“Hi,” “Why,” “Who are you”). If the input were any of those strings, the associated command would be executed. Otherwise, the command associated with the else statement (which prints “Have a great day!”) would be executed. . Nested Selection Statements: When a program can choose from many paths to lead to a result, think of flowcharts where one condition must be satisfied before another can be picked . Python For/While loops with Range with List: There are two ways loops can be used one is with a range and the other is with a list. When using the range method a variable is iterated a set number of times based on the range (typically an integer value), while with the list method the loop is iterated based on the length of a list. Range: i = 0 while i &lt; 5: print(i + 1) i += 1 Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 . List: list = [“a”, “b”, “c”] i = 0 while i&lt;len(list): print(list[i]) i = i + 1 Output: a, b, c . Combining loops with conditionals to Break: Makes it so that the loop will stop as soon as a condition is met . Continue: A statement used in while and for loops which starts the code from the beginning, in the image below you can see how the “h” in “Python” was not printed since the continue statement skipped the print(letter) and made the code start from the beginning for letter in “python”: if letter == “n”: continue print(letter) Output: pytho . Procedural Abstraction: A model of what the code should do but it doen’t tell how to do it. It’s basically using a procedure to name the idea. . Python Def: It defines a function and makes code simpler by allowing for the code in the function to be called . Procedures: Code that doesn’t return a value but allows for a specific task to be completed . Parameters: Values that are passed into functions when they are defined in addition(a + b), a and b will be given a value and that value is a parameter . Return Values: Values that are outputed when a function is completed. An example of this was when we were using console.log(“message”) when testing in AppLab. .",

            "content": "Hack 1 . Please write a short 1-2 sentence explanation describing the difference between decidable and undecidable problems. Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . Decidable problems are those for which an algorithm exists that can solve the problem in a finite amount of time, while undecidable problems are those for which no such algorithm exists. An example of a decidable problem is determining whether a given number is even or odd as shown below: . x = int(input(&quot;Type a number: &quot;)) if x % 2 == 1: print(x, &quot;is odd&quot;) else: print(x, &quot;is even&quot;) . 5 is odd . And an example of an undeciable problem is the Halting Problem which basically a program and its input are given, and it needs to be determine whether or not the program will run forever. This problem is undecidable because it is possible for a program to contain an infinite loop that never halts. . Hack 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 . B. 4^5 . C. (3 x 8)^2 . D. None of the above . E. All of the above . The answer is C since first the 3 and 8 are multiplied giveing 24. Second the previous result is squared (24^2) which give 576.

Lesson Takeaway . Simulations are useful for a variety of purposes in coding. Some of the benefits of using simulations include: . Testing and debugging: Simulations can be used to test and debug code by allowing developers to see how their code behaves in different scenarios. This can be especially useful when working with complex systems or when trying to identify and fix issues that might not be immediately apparent. | Modeling and prediction: Simulations can be used to model and predict the behavior of real-world systems, allowing developers to better understand and predict how a system will behave under different conditions. | Expense: Simulations can also help reduce the cost for testing since less equipment is required to test code. | Overall, simulations are an important tool that can help developers to design, test, and optimize their code, and to better understand and predict the behavior of complex systems. . Making a Simulation . The simulation below give the time, position, and velocity values of an object which is in free fall. It starts with an inital position of 50m and an inital velocity of 0m/s.

Out of these my favority was probably Ceramics because there was a lot of diversity amoung the pieces that couldn’t really be seen in the other classes. . Pieces I Liked . From ceramics I liked this plate because of its high contrast colors which really made each component of the piece be enhanced. Not to mention it has the ablity to be functional. I feel like there were many pieces which focused on aesthetic over functionality this year in Ceramics which probably made me like this piece more, since it focused on both aesthetic and functionality. . . From AP Studio Art there are hese two pieces which seem to be digital art. . . In this piece I really liked how there was a lot of detail in the background becasue it really added to the atmosphere. For example, in the right side of the page there are wires which seem to be attached to something and throughout the piece there’s graffiti around the walls which adds dimention to them. The shadows add a lot of contrast to this piece and along with the lighting it really made the whole piece look realistic becasue it adds depth. . . In this piece there is a girl looking at a giant goldfish which makes me really like it becasue of it’s fantasy element. It really reminds me of a portal to another world and that surreal aspect of this makes the piece interesting to look at. . The final piece I want to show is this one from Drawing and Painting . . Abstract art is my favorite type of art which probably makes this my views for this piece biased, but I really liked how it incorperated shadows and light to make such a chaotic piece. .",

We were inspired by many students’ studious and driven culture and wanted to create a site that could help them. A problem that we noticed among many students, especially those in advanced English courses, is that they often don’t know or can’t remember the word they want to use. Through the use of this website, we want to help these students allowing them to do well where ever they choose to use this website. . Row 2: Data Abstraction . We could either make a file which has a list of words and its synonyms or find an API which already does this. . Row 3: Managing Complexity . We could simplify code by storing the synonyms in a list or dictionary, allowing for unnecessary code to be removed . Row 4: Procedural Abstraction . The word would be a user input which would then be compared with other words and then the words it matches would be outputed . Row 5: Algorithm Implementation . Loops can be used to repeate the process of finding words related to the inputed word until all of the words in the list are oub=putted . Row 6: Testing . The main thing that would need to be tested many times is the is the API but something that will be tested as well is the formatting and user input to see if both of them work well with the UI .",

            "content": "Computer science is a diverse community that includes people from various majors ranging from aerospace engineering to mechanical engineering. Although people from other engineering majors may not be taught coding in their curriculum, they will still use it to automate menial tasks through scripting, which allows for the optimization of many tasks. And the thought process behind computer science can also apply to other majors and make one a better problem-solver. Although many people go into computer science because of their interests from a young age, this is not always the case. Some people may find it necessary for future opportunities, while others learn it for convenience. Despite its importance, computer science has many challenging aspects, such as keeping motivated, getting started, and resisting the temptation to write nonsense. Motivation is hard to find when it seems everyone is better and doing more than you. And the advice given for this was to focus on what you are doing, and you need to stay on your own path. Getting started could seem complicated because there may not be a structure, or you may be unable to find a solution. But you don’t need the plan to be rigid, and you can Google your question and get the knowledge of those who came before you. And finally, to keep yourself from writing nonsense, you must ensure that no corners are cut, and everything is followed correctly. Overall this panel was really informative and taught me how computer science applies in engineering and how to overcome common challenges many people have. .",

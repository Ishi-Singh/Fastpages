Program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward, and rotating right. Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the upper-left corner of the grid. . 37 . Both code segments display the correct average. Code segment I requires more arithmetic operations because it performs the operation sum/LENGTH(numList) within the loop, while code segment II performs the same operation only once. . 40 . The average total points earned per student can be determined using the result of the total points calculation for each student. The average increase in total points per student as a result of the score replacement policy can be determined by calculating the differences between each student score before and after the replacement policy was applied. The proportion of students who improved their total points as a result of the score replacement policy can be determined by comparing the midterm and final scores for each student with the result of the total points calculation. . 47 .

If the links from F to G, from F to A, and from F to E were broken, it would not be possible for computers E and F to communicate. . Q6 . Data is just broken down to packets and it isn’t encrypted. . Q12 . The number of statements in a program is not likely to affect how a program will handle larger data sets. The efficiency of a program is independent of the number of statements it contains. There are some programs with very few statements that take a long time to execute, as well as programs with many statements that take little time to execute. . Q28 . 32-bits can be represented as 2^32 which is 2,147,483,647, while 64-bits can be written as 2^64 which is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 which is 2^32 times as many values . Q37 . As n increases, the number of steps is approximately equal to n^2 which would make the algorithm polynomial. An algorithm with an efficiency that approximates n^2 is said to run in a reasonable amount of time. . Q49 . This code segment traverses the list beginning with the second element, so it is correctly comparing only student scores to the maximum possible score, which is found by accessing scores[1]. The variable found will only be set to true when a student’s score equals the maximum possible score. The code also sets the number of iterations to LENGTH(scores) - 1 to reflect that the first list element (maximum score) is skipped. .",

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is constant. | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # It contains unique values in an increasing order # Although there are two 1s and 2s they are only displayed once in the output # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # # Both remove duplicate values . {1, 2, 3} .

And if I go to a college which has such oppertunites it would be both fun and benificial.

Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . 263 Alabama . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . 178 1.78 . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400 401 402 403 404 405 406 407 408 409 410 411 412 413 414 415 416 417 418 419 420 421 422 423 424 425 426 427 428 429 430 431 432 433 434 435 436 437 438 439 440 441 442 443 444 445 446 447 448 449 450 451 452 453 454 455 456 457 458 459 460 461 462 463 464 465 466 467 468 469 470 471 472 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 484 485 486 487 488 489 490 491 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 499 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 515 516 517 518 519 520 521 522 523 524 525 526 527 528 529 530 531 532 533 534 535 536 537 538 539 540 541 542 543 544 545 546 547 548 549 550 551 552 553 554 555 556 557 558 559 560 561 562 563 564 565 566 567 568 569 570 571 572 573 574 575 576 577 578 579 580 581 582 583 584 585 586 587 588 589 590 591 592 593 594 595 596 597 598 599 600 601 602 603 604 605 606 607 608 609 610 611 612 613 614 615 616 617 618 619 620 621 622 623 624 625 626 627 628 629 630 631 632 633 634 635 636 637 638 639 640 641 642 643 644 645 646 647 648 649 650 651 652 653 654 655 656 657 658 659 660 661 662 663 664 665 666 667 668 669 670 671 672 673 674 675 676 677 678 679 680 681 682 683 684 685 686 687 688 689 690 691 692 693 694 695 696 697 698 699 700 701 702 703 704 705 706 707 708 709 710 711 712 713 714 715 716 717 718 719 720 721 722 723 724 725 726 727 728 729 730 731 732 733 734 735 736 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827 828 829 830 831 832 833 834 835 836 837 838 839 840 841 842 843 844 845 846 847 848 849 850 851 852 853 854 855 856 857 858 859 860 861 862 863 864 865 866 867 868 869 870 871 872 873 874 875 876 877 878 879 880 881 882 883 884 885 886 887 888 889 890 891 892 893 894 895 896 897 898 899 900 901 902 903 904 905 906 907 908 909 910 911 912 913 914 915 916 917 918 919 920 921 922 923 924 925 926 927 928 929 930 931 932 933 934 935 936 937 938 939 940 941 942 943 944 945 946 947 948 949 950 951 952 953 954 955 956 957 958 959 960 961 962 963 964 965 966 967 968 969 970 971 972 973 974 975 976 977 978 979 980 981 982 983 984 985 986 987 988 989 990 991 992 993 994 995 996 997 998 999 . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) .

Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . [[18, 28], [18, 28]] . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . 263 . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) print(fibonacci(20)) #print(fibonacci(30)) #print(fibonacci(40)) . 6765 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n).

Hacks . Record your findings when testing the time elapsed of the different algorithms. In general quadratic take more processing time compared to linear and logorithmic is more efficiant than exponential if there are many values being tested. | . | Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. The first thing I noticed is the fact that there are different equations for different times. Something unusual I noticed is that there are repeating time complexities such as (n log(n)) for the best and average times for heap sort and quick sort. However their worst times are different, heap sort has the same equation but the equation for quick sort is (n^2). | . | Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? | Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm?

Machine Learning Visit Tutorials Point . Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

Visualization is specific to View, for the web visualization needs to be converted to HTML. . pathlib . File paths are different on Windows versus Mac and Linux. This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS&#39;s), pathlib is a solution to this problem. . What are commands you use in terminal to access files? ls | cd | pwd | . | What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? dir | ren | . | What are some of the major differences? A difference is that terminal has root as the base directory while windows has C:and in windows a forward slash is used while in terminal a backwards slash is used. Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code. | . | Why is path a big deal when working with images? The path allows the image to be accessed and used when a person calls for it, and if the path is incorrect, the image can&#39;t be accessed and this can lead to it not being displayed. | . | How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? Unit 5 talked about how programs can analyze and manipulate computer data which is similar to what we are doing with images in this unit. The meta data is information about the picture such as camera specs and location and this data can be analyzed through programs. | . | Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images?

Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow) . PIL (Python Image Library) . Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? . Binary represents data in 1s and 0s, Base64 represents binary data in 64 character, on the other hand Hexadecimal (Base16) represents data in 16 bites by using numbers 0-9 and letters a-f. Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. | . | ish --&gt; aXNo | . numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? I&#39;ve seen buffering a lot whenever I&#39;m searching for something and waiting for results, such as waiting for a search result from Google or for a video to load. | . | From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? Buffering leads to a worse user experience since it casues people to wait for results a way to limit buffering is through loading less data and this can be seen when watching videos, since most video sites pre-load a portion of the video before one watches it. | . | How do these effects apply to images? A larger image would take longer to load unless they are lossy files since those images are compressed causing them to load faster. | . | . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program. . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? Yes since it goes in an order which allows for one result to be returned before it goes onto another part of this program. | . | Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? Make a duplicate of an image | Get an average value for the color based on its rgb numbers | Set the value of those pixels to the calculated number | Return and display the image | | Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? The only thing different with the scaled image is its size but it can also cause the image to look warped if the ratio of the original and final image is not kept the same. | . | Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? Scaling an image to be smaller can reduce the amount of data it has so it would be considered a type of compression. Collegeboard says that compression reduces the number of bits used to represent data in a file. Which means that scaling an image is not considered to be a type of compression. | . | . from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(img): baseWidth = 320 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() # Set Properties of Image, Scale, and convert to Base64 def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(image[&#39;pil&#39;], image[&#39;format&#39;]) # Create Grey Scale Base64 representation of Image def image_management_add_html_grey(image): # Image open return PIL image object img = image[&#39;pil&#39;] format = image[&#39;format&#39;] img_data = img.getdata() # Reference https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pil-image-getdata/ image[&#39;data&#39;] = np.array(img_data) # PIL image to numpy array image[&#39;gray_data&#39;] = [] # key/value for data converted to gray scale # &#39;data&#39; is a list of RGB data, the list is traversed and hex and binary lists are calculated and formatted for pixel in image[&#39;data&#39;]: # create gray scale of image, ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-a-numpy-array-to-an-image/ average = (pixel[0] + pixel[1] + pixel[2]) // 3 # average pixel values and use // for integer division if len(pixel) &gt; 3: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average, pixel[3])) # PNG format else: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average)) # end for loop for pixels img.putdata(image[&#39;gray_data&#39;]) image[&#39;html_grey&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(img, format) # Jupyter Notebook Visualization of Images if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # Use numpy to concatenate two arrays images = image_data() # Display meta data, scaled view, and grey scale for each image for image in images: image_management(image) print(&quot;- meta data --&quot;) print(image[&#39;label&#39;]) print(image[&#39;source&#39;]) print(image[&#39;format&#39;]) print(image[&#39;mode&#39;]) print(&quot;Original size: &quot;, image[&#39;size&#39;]) print(&quot;Scaled size: &quot;, image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;]) print(&quot;-- original image --&quot;) display(HTML(image[&#39;html&#39;])) print(&quot; grey image -&quot;) image_management_add_html_grey(image) display(HTML(image[&#39;html_grey&#39;])) print() . - meta data -- Green Square Internet PNG RGBA Original size: (16, 16) Scaled size: (320, 320) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- Clouds Impression Peter Carolin PNG RGBA Original size: (320, 234) Scaled size: (320, 234) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- Lassen Volcano Peter Carolin JPEG RGB Original size: (2792, 2094) Scaled size: (320, 240) -- original image -- . grey image - . .

            "content": "Pieces I Liked . . The piece above was made by my friend and I find it interesting to look at since the colors go well together and the background looks really cool. This was done for AP Studio Art and there weren’t many other pieces which had animals. Out of both of these pieces my favorite was probably the parrot since it stood out from the background (since the bright blue and yellow were really saturated while the background was somewhat dull and gray) and it also had better details than the deer (even though the deer had spots on its back the wings of the parrot are more detailed and it looks really skillful). Not to mention the backgound was also better since it had more realistic textures which weren’t overpowering the center piece (the parrot). . . I liked this second piece because of its simplistic nature and how it potrays peacefulness. I also liked the slightly monochromatic color palette especially since it adds to how the piece looks. I also have a personal bias towards this since I like the ocean and other large bodies of water and the water was drawn well in this. Even though there isn’t much going on in the overall piece the way all of the elements such as the boat, water, and mountain come together makes it look good and well coordinated. . . This piece is from ceramics and it’s a turtle, I really like how the colors look since they go well together, especially since all of the color isn’t blended out completely and has a marble effect. Not to mention the design is also really creative and overall the piece is really well made. This probably took a lot of effort to make since the handles had a braided texture and the turtle even had an expression. I also wonder why the person decided to make a turtle, I’ve heaerd theat turtles represent wealth and longevity. These are typically seen as prosperous traits which is really cool. . . This is the final piece that I liked in N@tM and it’s a photograph, the main reason I like this is because of how saturated the colors are which makes them pop out and enhances the beauty of the piece. I also liked the right more since it has more contrast compared the the left one, and this contrast emphasizes certain details which adds to how the piece looks. I’m really interested in photography since it seems like a simple activity but actually requires a lot of skill (similar to other art mediums). Especially since there are many factors that go inot making a good photo such as the amount of exposure and the shutter speed. both of these pieces a really pretty and I hope that I’m able to take photos that look like this eventually. .",

The answer is B since both conditions don’t need to be satisfied in order for the elevator to work since the elevator needs to be on a different floor from which it’s called . Question 14: . . The answer is A since the output is true making it so that the input value of A must be true in order for that to occur . Question 15: . . The answer is D since it requires the robot to rotate left in order to reach the goal but it will rotate right since it comes before rotate left . Question 21: . . The answer is D since it’s an infinite loop since i is set to one every code is looped making it so that it never reaches i=4 . Question 27: . . The answer is D since it’s the only option that increases the distance the robot moves horizontally while keeping the vertical distance traveled the same . Question 30: . . The answer is B and C instead of C and D since the circles all have the same x-position of 4 and it’s only the y-position and radius changing . Question 32: . . The answer is C since program 1 the value of i starts at 1 and finishes at n so that result has the sum of all values from 1 to n while in program 2 the value of i starts at n and finishes at 1 so that result has the sum of all values from n to 1 which makes both o fthem have the correct sum .

            "content": "5.1 . Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing . Three benefits and corresponding harms of computing are: . Increasing efficancy at the expense of human jobs since people will probably lose their jobs to AI and computers | Access to more information at the expense of some people not having access to this information | Allowing for communication at the expense of dividing the world since not all people will have access to this communication the digital divide whould just be enhanced | . Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? . Many people especially high schoolers have dopamine issues and it’s something many of them have expirienced including me. The issue I have is the lack of motivation especially when it comes to school work. Something that I’m doing to fix this is by giving myself rewards for completing tasks with a break. And that allows me to decrease the impact of my dopamine issues. . 5.2 . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? . As technology beocmes more prevalent in society things such as fake news, getting hacked, or phished become more common and the best way to combat that is through being informed. Things such as checking muliple sites for news and being suspicious of random links people tell you to follow can prevent such events having a negative impact on one’s digital life. And having a safe and healthy place digitally can help someone empower themselves in the digital world. . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . Empowered people should help those who are not empowered by supporting them thorugh their goals and helping them progress. This allows for the creation of a healthy and supportive environment similar to the one they made themselves when they weren’t empowered. Something that can be done in Del Norte is by providing mentorship through clubs such as Peer Counselling or Link Crew which are aimed to help those in need. . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . Paper and red tape limit digital empowerment since they slow down decision making it inefficienct to do things. However it’s important to have necessary regulations in a digital environment to keep people protected. Digital safety is one of the most important things in the digital world and the only way to ensure privacy and security of information is by limiting paper or red tape. . 5.3 . Write summary/thoughts/conclusions from each of the exercises above. Focus on avoiding Bias in algorithms or code you write. . This section focused on how there can be a bias in computing especially if somehting such as AI is being used. The example shown was the HP computer video where the person stated that HP computers are racist. There are probably many reasons behind why the computer software didn’t work but I believe it’s because they didn’t test the AI with people who have a different skin color making it not work once the product was launched. And such bias can be really harmful for a coumpany since it limits the number of customers they get and decreases user satisfaction. . 5.4 . CompSci has 150-ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? . A crowdsource idea is an online forum where CSP students can communicate with other CSP students in other schools. How it would work is that students can post something (like code that isn’t working) and other students can reply with ideas to either improve or fix the other student’s code. This will allow for a creation of a healthy environment that will allow students to collaborate with each other across the nation and show what other classes are doing in their CSP. A Del Norte specific version could be done on slack with students utilizing the different channels to communicate their thoughts and difficulties. . What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? . Crowdsourcing for Del Norte as a school can be done on social media since it’s common for students to have it. Accounts such as dnhsasb can be used to spread polls and forms to get input and ideas from the students from our school. And our project can be better with crowdsourcing since it would allow us to know more about what the user wants from our website. Which would lead to a more innovated design for our site. . What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. . Something we can capture at N@tM is user satisfaction with our services or how much our service actually helped them. This is similar to what my team did last trimester where we had a review portion for our project where people could give us a 1-5 rating on questions we ask about their experience. And this data can help us to improve or change our features so that it’s more beneficial to those who need our service. . 5.5 . When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. . One License typw that can be seen on GitHub is the MIT License which is an open-source license that allows others to use, modify, and distribute code as long as they provide attribution. Another one is the GPL License which is also an open-source license that requires others to release the source code of their derivative works if they distribute the code. . In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic. . They talk about things such as licenses and how sometimes they are needed and as for legal and ethical thoughts are often about ethical considerations associated with the use and distribution of software and digital content, such as privacy, security, and intellectual property rights. . 5.6 . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. . PIIs that are mostly used in CSP are things such as names and emails since we use them to sign up into our Github accounts and Slack. And we don’t have to worry about thhings like our SSN or finantial passwords leaking since there isn’t anything that involves such transactions. . What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? . I would say that I have a constant exposure to PIIs since they are asked for everywhere whenever you want to sign-up for a website or whenever you go out to a store. And becasue of this I would say that I’m desensitized to putting in most of this information, and to some extent I also expect a pop-up which shows that we need to sign-in in order to use the service. . Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. . Typically a good password is considered to be one which is eight or more characters long, has both upper and undercase letter, and has numbers and symbols. You can make your password Pa$$w0rd since all of the above critirion are met but not 12345678 since it only fits having 8 or more characters and having numbers. Most bad passwords are those which can easily be guessed such as birthdays or “password.” However if a person has a password like that they still have a chance to be secure. This is through two-factor-authentication which gives the person a notification on code that needs to be used in order to use the other device. . Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. . In Symmetric encryption the encryption and decryption key is the same while in Asymmetric encryption the encryption and decryption key are different and that allows for more security since it stops unauthorized people from gaining access. . Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. . In AWS an exaple of encryption we can see is SSH encrytion when we are making an instance and have to make an SSH client which gives an unique key that can be used by us. . Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. . A phishing scheme I have learned about is the one where there is an email sent out to users saying that they have a debt that they need to give their credit card information and this causes the hacker to gain access to the bank account of the person and use it to do malacious things. .",

Hacks . The Big Picture purpose of this hack is to build a database. Being able to create an SQLite table and populate test data within it is the major goal. To do this effectively it is imperative to show the following. . Build Schema for a table, make a new model file and use users.py as an example. Start slow and simple and build up. | Build an initXXXXX() method and use it to add preliminary/test data to the table. Once again use users.py as an example. | Make a 30-60 second video where you show a Debugging session of making new rows in the table. Use sqlite marketplace tools and/or sqlite3 command line tool to show success in creating table and adding data. | Hack Helper . Here are some tips. . Become familiar with initUsers(). Observe it is called/activated from main.py. This function activates after you run the main.py and activate the web application in the browser. Observe that the sqlite.db file will appear in the volumes directory in conjunction with home screen of site appearing in browser. . | Delete sqlite.db from volumes directory on your development machine. Set breakpoint on initUsers() and run main.py using debug. Use the step into option on the debugger and observe the creation of data. . | . @app.before_first_request def activate_job():initJokes() initUsers() . Make your own XXXXX.py file under model directory. Follow users.py and develop your own schema from the OOP code you did in last Hacks. Follow the pattern in users.py to make a initXXXX() function top populate some test data. . | In main.py, add your initXXXX() method to def activate_job() function shown above. Use this as basis of your video debugging session. Debugging is hugely important at this level to understand your database success prior to building an API. Building initXXXX() method, adding database records, and debugging will enable you to verify CRUD operations as you develop. . | .",

            "content": "About the Speakers . Kathyleen Beveridge is a Director of Marketing and she got her undergrad at Santa Clara and a bachelors in finance there as well. And she lives by the quote Maya Angelou “My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive”. In her presentation she emphasized how all companies want to use technology for the greater good of the people and do something the world wants, citing Qualcomm, Thermo Fisher Scientific, and HP Inc. as examples. . Kris Porter is a Software Engineer SRE DevOps and he went to UCLA for electrical engineering with a focus on communications. He’s done many things such as work for centers for Embedded Network Sensors and Networked Info Mechanical systems (NIMs). Not to mention he has a lot of experience since he’s worked in many places like Systems Engineer at Startup (GPM), NBC Universal (streaming media infrastructure in the 2012 olympics), Intro to DevOps at Qualcomm, Twitter (new datacenter deployment and migrating home timeline to graphql). And he is going to work at Mysten Labs. In his presentation he emphasized how he values continuous learning. And he shared things he’s learned like CCNA training, Machine Learning and Deep Learning (Qualcomm), Python (Udemy) and things he wants to learn like blockchains, AWS, and google cloud stuff. . QnA . Agile Methodology is different for each company and they all have different versions of it for their own purpos. Qualcomm uses roadmaps since there are many people working on project together and this allows for organization amoung many people. While Thermo Fisher Scientific uses short sprints to be able to do long projects. | When Kris Porter was learning Machine Learning in Qualcomm he learned how to use python libraries and other machine learning frameworks, NDS system, and how to use info (if people are downloading things) to archive and delete repositories since they cost money. | Machine learning in Thermo Fisher Scientific is used to predict where demand for products will be before products are made. | Skills that are considered the most important in the industry are: | . Continuous learning (continue to get better at your skill) and don’t be super concerned about things you read on the news, and there’s only risk if you’re not learning. . Being adaptive (best people are like this, listen to requirements and translates it to how tech can solve requirement) . Some of the biggest challenges they have faced include semiconductor industries going through acquisitions and interviews since it’s series of timed random test where you have to solve a problem in 30-45 mins | Having coding skills allows for a different way of thinking that increased critical thinking and problem solving skills a question that Kathyleen Beveridge likes to ask is “You’re in a room with no electronics you only have pen and paper how many cars did the US sell last year. And the main thing she wants to see is the way the person solves the problem and comes to a conclusion. | .",

            "content": "Bits: A bit or a binary digit, is the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store. A bit can be one of 2 physical states, such as either 0 or 1, yes or no, and true or false. . Bytes: A byte is a unit of data that is eight bits long. It is used by computers to represent a character such as a letter or number symbol. . Hexadecimal: Hexadecimal is a numbering system with base 16. There are 16 symbols or possible digit values from 0 to 9, followed by six alphabetic characters – A, B, C, D, E and F. It can be used to represent large numbers with fewer digits. . Nibbles . Binary Numbers: . Unsigned Integer: Numbers without + or - sign, only representing the magnitude not the direction. Used when we know that the value we are storing will always be non-negative Ex. 1, 2, 3, 4 . Signed Integer: The default where the variable can hold positive or negative numbers Ex. -1, 6, -29, 1000 . Floating Point: Positive or negative whole number with a decimal point. Used to represent real numbers and is written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts Ex. 1.23, 87.425, and -9039454.2, NOT 101, -3, 18203 . Binary Data Abstractions: . Boolean: Variable type that represents one of two values: True or False. A = 200 B = 33 If b &gt; a: print(“b is greater than a”) If a &gt; b: print(“a is greater than b”) . ASCII: Stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. ASCII was first created when all people wanted computers to be able to show was numbers, letters, punctuation, and non-printing commands(Enter, Delete, F1).. All ASCII encoded character can be represented by 1 byte, or 8 bits for a total of 2^8 = 127 different total characters. Ex. lowercase “h” character → 104 (D) → 01101000(B) . Unicode: today, people use emojis and new symbols like other languages and stuff and computers needed to be able to represent all that. Unicode is a new standard defining an association between characters and even more numbers. Each unicode character (utf8) is 4 bytes, or 32 bits, enough for 2^32 different characters. Most modern programming languages represent strings as utf8 encoded characters (hex) because people use these new symbols in their code, but old languages like C still associate either character type with a single byte integer Ex. “Hello” → U+0048 U+0065 U+006C U+006C U+006F . RGB: RGB (red, green, and blue) refers to a system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display.These 3 colors can be combined in various proportions to obtain any color in the visible spectrum. Ex. rgb(255, 0, 0) = red because red is set to its highest value (255), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 0. Data Compression . Lossy: a technique that reduces file size by discarding less important information . Lossless: Every bit of data originally in a file remains after it is uncompressed, and all the information is restored. . Variables: An abstraction inside a program that holds a specific value or meaning defined by the programmer. . Data Types: . Integer: highScore (involves math, save as integer or numbers) . String: firstName (name is text, so it is a string) . Boolean: isSunny (2 options, true or false) . String: phoneNumber (no math, just numbers) . Arithmetic Operators: Plus indicated addition (a + b) Minus indicates subtractions (a - b) Asterisk indicated multiplication (a * b) Slash indicated division (a / b) Managing Complexity with Variables . Lists: Allows you to complete a process for each value in the list, or store multiple values to one variable. . 2D Lists: Array within an array. You can pull single arrays through using index and variable commands. Ex: T = [[11, 12, 5, 2], [15, 6,10], [10, 8, 12, 5], [12,15,8,6]] . Dictionaries: Allows the storage or data keys and values (assigning a certain piece of data to fit the category it is assigned) . Class: A particular data structure. . Algorithms: An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task, us as humans, do algorithms on a daily basis. . Sequence: A specific order a process is completed, which impacts the output. . Selection: Programmer decides between 2 different functions . Iteration: Repetition of a process . For loop: repeats a section of code a set number of times . While loop: repearts a section of code an unknown number of times, until the code is told to break . Expressions: A piece of syntax in coding . Comparison Operators: Operators used in programming languages which compare two different values. These can often be used to set up statements which return a boolean value (true/false), which can be stored in variables. All examples below are in Python and were checked using the bool() command, which returns the True/False output. . Operator: Function True output example False output example Notes == Checks if two values are equal to each other “Hrar” == “Hrar” 1 == 1.0 “Hrar” == “hrar” 1 == 2 If strings are compared, this is case-sensitive. Follows numerical equivalence if a float and integer is used. Cannot use leading zeros for integers/floats. != Checks if two values are not equal to each other “Hrar” != “hrar” 1 != 2 “Hrar” != “Hrar” 1 != 1.0 Similar to above. &lt; Checks if the left value is less than the right value 1 &lt; 2 “zz” &lt; “hi” 2 &lt; 1 “az” &lt; “hi” 2 &lt; 2 If strings are compared, the string appearing last in alphabetical order is considered less. float(‘NaN’) and decimal.Decimal(‘NaN’) will yield false regardless of what they are compared to. . Checks if the left value is greater than the right value 2 &gt; 1 “az” &gt; “hi” 1 &gt; 2 “zz” &gt; “hi” 2 &gt; 2 Similar to above &lt;= Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value 1 &lt;= 2 “zz” &lt;= “hi” 2 &lt;= 2 2 &lt;= 1 “az” &lt;= “hi” Similar to above = Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value 2 &gt;= 1 “az” &gt;= “hi” 2 &gt;= 2 1 &gt;= 2 “zz” &gt;= “hi” . Similar to above in/not in Checks if the specified value is an element in the specified list. in returns true if the element is in the list; not in returns true if the element is not in the list. . Example: List = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, “hi”] 1 in List 3 in List 5 in List “hi” in List “What” not in List “Why” not in List 2 in List 4 in List 6 in List 9 not in List 7 not in List “Weird” in List As usual, strings are case-sensitive. May be useful for conditional statements. . Booleans Expressions and Selection: The value of a boolean variable (True/False) can be used as conditions in selection (often known as if statements). The condition of the if statement is the boolean variable; if its value is True, the condition passes. A possible function of this is in Python code below . Grade = 89.49 isA = bool(Grade &gt;= 90) . if isA: print(“Yay!”) else: print(“hmm”) . OUTPUT: hmm . Booleans Expressions and Iteration: Certain forms of iteration (specifically while loops in Python) can use a boolean variable as a condition (similar to selection commands). As you may expect, the while loop executes commands until the value of the variable is false. In terms of a computer program, this could perhaps be used to execute commands critical for maintaining a certain process until that process is no longer needed. This could also potentially be used to periodically send notifications until a certain condition is met (ex: an assignment is submitted) Here’s some informal python code: num = 10 correct = bool(num &gt; 0) . while correct: print(num) num = num - 1 correct = bool(num &gt; 0) . OUTPUT: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 . Truth Tables: A table for a logical operator (ex: AND, OR, XOR) containing each variable and all possible input and output results of that operator. . AND TABLE: All inputs must be true to return output of true. . Input 1 Input 2 Output False False False False True False True False False True True True . OR TABLE: At least one input must be true to return output of true. . Input 1 Input 2 Output False False False False True True True False True True True True . XOR TABLE: Exactly one input must be true to return output of true. . Input 1 Input 2 Output False False False False True True True False True True True False . Characters: The units which make up a string. These can be letters, numbers, special symbols (!@#$%^&amp;*), or even spaces. Regardless, if one types, each keystroke outputs one character. Ex: “keyboard hi!!!” has 14 characters: 10 letters, three exclamation marks, and a space. . Strings: A variable data type which consists of a combination of letters, numbers, and other special characters (ex: @#$%^&amp;*). They are seen inside quotation marks, and operators cannot affect any numbers in the string. Ex: stringVar = “Hello World!” “Hello World!” is a string. . Length: The number of elements in a list. Here’s an example in Python: numList = [1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1] This list has a length of 17 because it has 17 elements. Each element is separated by a comma. . Concatenation: the act of joining two strings into a single string. Often, these strings are printed to an output terminal/console. Here’s an example in pseudocode: concat(“tri”, “llion”) This concatenates the strings “tri” and “llion”, making a new string “trillion”. Upper, Lower, Traversing Strings The first two (upper and lower) seem to be referring to Python methods. They are quite simple. I think it would be easiest to explain with a demonstration: . String = “WhYaReWeDoInGtHiS” . print(string) print(string.upper()) print(string.lower()) . Output: WhYaReWeDoInGtHiS WHYAREWEDOINGTHIS whyarewedoingthis . Relatively intuitive. The upper() method changes all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase, while the lower() method does the opposite. A potential reason for this would be ensuring uniform case (especially of uppercase when making important headings like page/screen titles) Traversing strings behaves highly similar to iterating elements in a list, except that instead of iterating through a list, it’s a string. Elements in a list are now the characters of a string. A potential application of this could be to search all strings for a specific substring. Here’s some example python code: . #Very informative example here: #https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterate-over-characters-of-a-string-in-python/ . String = “Thirty Trillion Dollars” . for i in String: if i == “T” print(“T detected!”) . Output: T detected! T detected! . Python If, Elif, Else conditionals: Python if statements execute associated lines of code if the if condition is satisfied. If the if condition is not satisfied, an Elif statement is executed as fallback… with another condition and associated commands If all associated Elif conditions are not satisfied, there can be an else statement which unconditionally executes associated commands. Ex: input = input(“enter a string”) if input == “Hi”: print(“Hello World!”) print(“How are you doing today?”) elif input == “Why”: print(“That’s a good question to ask about everything that happens.”) elif input == “Who are you”: print(“I’m an anonymous guest. Pleased to meet you.”) else: print(“Have a great day!”) . This code uses if statements and elif statements to return strings for three special inputs (“Hi,” “Why,” “Who are you”). If the input were any of those strings, the associated command would be executed. Otherwise, the command associated with the else statement (which prints “Have a great day!”) would be executed. . Nested Selection Statements: When a program can choose from many paths to lead to a result, think of flowcharts where one condition must be satisfied before another can be picked . Python For/While loops with Range with List: There are two ways loops can be used one is with a range and the other is with a list. When using the range method a variable is iterated a set number of times based on the range (typically an integer value), while with the list method the loop is iterated based on the length of a list. Range: i = 0 while i &lt; 5: print(i + 1) i += 1 Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 . List: list = [“a”, “b”, “c”] i = 0 while i&lt;len(list): print(list[i]) i = i + 1 Output: a, b, c . Combining loops with conditionals to Break: Makes it so that the loop will stop as soon as a condition is met . Continue: A statement used in while and for loops which starts the code from the beginning, in the image below you can see how the “h” in “Python” was not printed since the continue statement skipped the print(letter) and made the code start from the beginning for letter in “python”: if letter == “n”: continue print(letter) Output: pytho . Procedural Abstraction: A model of what the code should do but it doen’t tell how to do it. It’s basically using a procedure to name the idea. . Python Def: It defines a function and makes code simpler by allowing for the code in the function to be called . Procedures: Code that doesn’t return a value but allows for a specific task to be completed . Parameters: Values that are passed into functions when they are defined in addition(a + b), a and b will be given a value and that value is a parameter . Return Values: Values that are outputed when a function is completed. An example of this was when we were using console.log(“message”) when testing in AppLab. .",

An example of a decidable problem is determining whether a given number is even or odd as shown below: . x = int(input(&quot;Type a number: &quot;)) if x % 2 == 1: print(x, &quot;is odd&quot;) else: print(x, &quot;is even&quot;) . 5 is odd . And an example of an undeciable problem is the Halting Problem which basically a program and its input are given, and it needs to be determine whether or not the program will run forever. This problem is undecidable because it is possible for a program to contain an infinite loop that never halts. . Hack 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 . B. 4^5 . C. (3 x 8)^2 . D. None of the above . E. All of the above . The answer is C since first the 3 and 8 are multiplied giveing 24. Second the previous result is squared (24^2) which give 576. Giving a result of 576. And this takes a total of three steps. . Hack 3 .

Lesson Takeaway . Simulations are useful for a variety of purposes in coding. Some of the benefits of using simulations include: . Testing and debugging: Simulations can be used to test and debug code by allowing developers to see how their code behaves in different scenarios. This can be especially useful when working with complex systems or when trying to identify and fix issues that might not be immediately apparent. | Modeling and prediction: Simulations can be used to model and predict the behavior of real-world systems, allowing developers to better understand and predict how a system will behave under different conditions. | Expense: Simulations can also help reduce the cost for testing since less equipment is required to test code. | Overall, simulations are an important tool that can help developers to design, test, and optimize their code, and to better understand and predict the behavior of complex systems. . Making a Simulation . The simulation below give the time, position, and velocity values of an object which is in free fall. It starts with an inital position of 50m and an inital velocity of 0m/s. And it changes these values based on the time value 10 times. . g = 9.8 ## Gravity in m/s^2 dt = 0.25 ## This is the step value for time in s x = 50 ## Inital position in m v = 0 ## Inital velocity in m/s for t in range(10): ## For the first 10 values x = x + v * dt ## This calculates the position and velocity ## xf = xi + vt v = v - g * dt ## vf = vi + at x = round(x, 3) ## Rounds to 3 decimal places v = round(v, 3) print(&quot;Time:&quot;, t+dt,&quot; &quot;, &quot;Position:&quot;, x,&quot; &quot;, &quot;Velocity:&quot;, v) .

The value of hot is true, the value of cold is true | The value of hot is false, the value of cold is true | The value of hot is true, the value of cold is false | The value of hot is false, the value of cold is false | Answer 1: since cold is assigned as hot which was assigned true and hot is assigned as cold which was assigned true . Making Questions . Consider the following coding segment: a ⟵ 5 b ⟵ 10 c ⟵ 2 d ⟵ 4 a ⟵ b - a b ⟵ c + d d ⟵ a + b | What is the value of d? . Answer: 11; a is assigned as b - a which can be rewritten as 10 - 5 which can be simplified to 5, giving the value of 5 to a. The value of b is c + d which can be written as 2 + 4 which is simplified to 6. And since d is assigned as a + b, by using the most recent values of these variables you would get 5 + 6 which is simplified to 11 . Consider the following coding segment: | a ⟵ 1 b ⟵ 2 c ⟵ 3 d ⟵ 4 a ⟵ c** b ⟵ a + d d ⟵ a + b + c . What is the value of d? . Answer: 25; to get the value of a one must square c which whould make a = 9, by adding that to d one gets 9 + 4 which is 13, and to get the value of d one would add 9 + 13 + 3 which gives 25. . num1 = 3 num2 = 1 num3 = 5 num1 = num2 + num3 num2 = num1 + num3 # num2 is now the new num1 + num3 . num1 = 6 since num2 + num3 can be rewritten as 1 + 5 and that simplifies to 6 num2 = 11 since num1 + num3 can be rewritten as 6 + 5 which is 11 . 3.4 Video 1 Hacks . String Homework . Test 1 . firstName &lt;- &quot;Bob&quot; lastName &lt;- &quot;Smith&quot; var &lt;- substring(firstName, 1, 1) name &lt;- concat(lastName, var) email &lt;- concat(name, &quot;@gmail.com&quot;) DISPLAY(email) . What would the result be? . Hint: var = &quot;B&quot; name = &quot;SmithB&quot; . Answer: SmithB@gmail.com; only the firstletter is taken from firstName and it&#39;s added to the end of lastName which gives SmithB and then @gmail.com is concatinated with the name which gives SmithB@gmail.com . Test 2 . word1 &lt;- &quot;computer&quot; word2 &lt;- &quot;textbooks&quot; length1 &lt;- len(word1)/2 length2 &lt;- len(word2)/3 first &lt;- substring(word1, 2, len1) second &lt;- substring(word2, len2+3, len2) newWord &lt;- concat(first, second) DISPLAY(newWord) . Answer: ompuook; length1 can be written as 8/2 or 4 since &quot;computer&quot; is 8 letters long and length2 is 3 since it can be written as 9/3 which is 3. The variable first is ompu since it&#39;s 4 letters long and starts at the second letter and second is ook since it&#39;s 3 letters and starts at the 6th letter. And when these are added together one gets &quot;ompuook&quot; .",

Classes I went to inclues AP Studio Art, Ceramics, and Draw and Painting. Out of these my favority was probably Ceramics because there was a lot of diversity amoung the pieces that couldn’t really be seen in the other classes. . Pieces I Liked . From ceramics I liked this plate because of its high contrast colors which really made each component of the piece be enhanced. Not to mention it has the ablity to be functional. I feel like there were many pieces which focused on aesthetic over functionality this year in Ceramics which probably made me like this piece more, since it focused on both aesthetic and functionality. . . From AP Studio Art there are hese two pieces which seem to be digital art. . . In this piece I really liked how there was a lot of detail in the background becasue it really added to the atmosphere. For example, in the right side of the page there are wires which seem to be attached to something and throughout the piece there’s graffiti around the walls which adds dimention to them. The shadows add a lot of contrast to this piece and along with the lighting it really made the whole piece look realistic becasue it adds depth. . . In this piece there is a girl looking at a giant goldfish which makes me really like it becasue of it’s fantasy element. It really reminds me of a portal to another world and that surreal aspect of this makes the piece interesting to look at. . The final piece I want to show is this one from Drawing and Painting . . Abstract art is my favorite type of art which probably makes this my views for this piece biased, but I really liked how it incorperated shadows and light to make such a chaotic piece. .",

Although people from other engineering majors may not be taught coding in their curriculum, they will still use it to automate menial tasks through scripting, which allows for the optimization of many tasks. And the thought process behind computer science can also apply to other majors and make one a better problem-solver. Although many people go into computer science because of their interests from a young age, this is not always the case. Some people may find it necessary for future opportunities, while others learn it for convenience. Despite its importance, computer science has many challenging aspects, such as keeping motivated, getting started, and resisting the temptation to write nonsense. Motivation is hard to find when it seems everyone is better and doing more than you. And the advice given for this was to focus on what you are doing, and you need to stay on your own path. Getting started could seem complicated because there may not be a structure, or you may be unable to find a solution. But you don’t need the plan to be rigid, and you can Google your question and get the knowledge of those who came before you. And finally, to keep yourself from writing nonsense, you must ensure that no corners are cut, and everything is followed correctly. Overall this panel was really informative and taught me how computer science applies in engineering and how to overcome common challenges many people have. .",

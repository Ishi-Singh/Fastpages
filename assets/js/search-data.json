            "content": "I affirm the resolution Resolved: The appropriation of outer space by private entities is unjust. . My value for this round is morality principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior . And my criterion is environmentalism movement and ideology that aims to reduce the impact of human activities . I provide the following definitions for clarification: . Appropriation: the action of taking something for one’s own use . Outer space: the physical universe beyond the earth’s atmosphere . Private entities: Privately owned companies and partnerships . Unjust: not based on or behaving according to what is morally right and fair . Contention 1: Space doesn’t belong to anyone . According to the Outer Space Treaty (1967) states “Outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.” Therefore occupying and using any section of outer space is unlawful. However, this potentially doesn’t apply to private companies as stated by Calanchi 2021 “Private ventures may even bypass current legislation (the Outer Space Treaty), which states that nations – governments – cannot claim ownership of other planets” Meaning the government could tell private companies to do actions which go against the outer space treaty. . Contention 2: Environmental issues will rise if people go to space . Subpoint A: . By going to space people are neglecting Earth by going to another place for a “reset”. The main reason many billionaires are going to space is to colonize the moon. Elon Musk said on Twitter last year that he plans to build up to 100 Starships each year to colonize the solar system. And the reason that SpaceX was founded was to make life multi-planetary. Without colonization, this would not be possible, and logically speaking the first people who would go to space would be renowned scientists. Without them, efforts to improve life on Earth would be minimalized and eventually stopped. . Subpoint B: . There would also be an increase in outer space pollution with the colonization of outer space. According to CALPIRG Californians throw away 6 pounds of trash per day which makes 2200 pounds a year. All of this trash goes to landfills on Earth but in outer space, this trash must be stored somewhere and it has a chance to contribute to space debris. According to Undseth et al. (2021) “A large number of long-term simulations including different scenarios of future small satellite traffic have been performed. From these simulations, several conclusions can be drawn: In all performed simulations, small satellites had a significant impact on the long-term space debris environment.” This provides insight to the problems that increased space can have, not to mention space debris stays in orbit until it enters the atmosphere. So with the increase of space travel there will be an increase of space debris leading there to be a higher chance for that debris to fall on Earth. It not only affects Earth but also satellites because of it being in orbit. . Contention 3: Another space race can be started . Private companies are also going to space because of precious resources that can be found within celestial objects. The space industry is already worth 350 billion dollars and it could triple by 2040. Scientists fear that the Moon might be plundered too quickly by private companies hoping to extract its valuable resources. Martin Elvis says “A lot of people think of space as a place of peace and harmony between nations. The problem is there’s no law to regulate who gets to use the resources, and there are a significant number of space agencies and others in the private sector that aim to land on the moon within the next five years, We looked at all the maps of the Moon we could find and found that not very many places had resources of interest, and those that did were very small. That creates a lot of room for conflict over certain resources.” A lack of international policies and agreements could result in tensions, overcrowding, and a rapid expansion of moon mining projects. Water and iron are particularly valuable resources that could be collected from the Moon, which would help companies construct infrastructure and develop agriculture as well as letting them avoid the vast expense of transporting such materials from the Earth.” If a large number of private entities go to space they would need to get resources from space because it would be cheaper than getting resources from Earth. But the problem with this is that specific resources in celestial objects are scarce, so there is a decent chance that private entities will either make a monopoly on resources or they will fight for them. Fighting is obviously bad because it can cause harm to humans. And monopolies make one entity in control of the object, and this is bad because it forces consumers to buy unfair prices . Due to all these reasons private entities should focus on making Earth better, rather than developing new areas. . Thus I urge you the judge to vote affirmative for the resolution Resolved: The appropriation of outer space by private entities is unjust. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown.

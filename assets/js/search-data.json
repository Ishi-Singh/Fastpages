For this question I accidentally chose the wrong answer choice, but I knew the correct answer for this. But protocals are a way to standardize data across different manufacturers. . 24 . Skill 2B | Topic 2.1 | . . I knew that the binary number 1101 was larger than 1011 but I didn’t know what they were compared to decimal numbers. Binary 1011 is equal to decimal 11 and binary 1101 is equal to decimal 13. Making the order of the numbers in decimal 5, 11, 12, 13 and once converted back it becomes Decimal 5, binary 1011, decimal 12, binary 1101. . 39 . Skill 3A | Topic 3.2 | . This question is asking about the list not the values in the list, the list elements are strings, the indices of a list are typically nonnegative integers. . 46 . Skill 4B | Topic 3.1 | . . The first two statements assign values to the variables, the third statement assigns the value of first to second, and the fourth statement assigns the value of second to first making both values true. . 47 . Skill 4B | Topic 3.3 | . . The values are assigned in the first five statements. The sixth statement assigns the value of x + b to b, the seventh statement assigns the value of x + 1 to a, the eighth statement assigns the value of c + d / 2 to d, and the last four statements display the values of a, b, c, d in that order making the answer 21 40 30 50. .",

Classes I went to inclues AP Studio Art, Ceramics, and Draw and Painting. Out of these my favority was probably Ceramics because there was a lot of diversity amoung the pieces that couldn’t really be seen in the other classes. . Pieces I Liked . From ceramics I liked this plate because of its high contrast colors which really made each component of the piece be enhanced. . From AP Studio Art there are hese two pieces which seem to be digital art. .",

We were inspired by many students’ studious and driven culture and wanted to create a site that could help them. A problem that we noticed among many students, especially those in advanced English courses, is that they often don’t know or can’t remember the word they want to use. Through the use of this website, we want to help these students allowing them to do well where ever they choose to use this website. . Row 2: Data Abstraction . We could either make a file which has a list of words and its synonyms or find an API which already does this. . Row 3: Managing Complexity . We could simplify code by storing the synonyms in a list or dictionary, allowing for unnecessary code to be removed . Row 4: Procedural Abstraction . The word would be a user input which would then be compared with other words and then the words it matches would be outputed . Row 5: Algorithm Implementation . Loops can be used to repeate the process of finding words related to the inputed word until all of the words in the list are oub=putted . Row 6: Testing . The main thing that would need to be tested many times is the is the API but something that will be tested as well is the formatting and user input to see if both of them work well with the UI .",

            "content": "Computer science is a diverse community that includes people from various majors ranging from aerospace engineering to mechanical engineering. Although people from other engineering majors may not be taught coding in their curriculum, they will still use it to automate menial tasks through scripting, which allows for the optimization of many tasks. And the thought process behind computer science can also apply to other majors and make one a better problem-solver. Although many people go into computer science because of their interests from a young age, this is not always the case. Some people may find it necessary for future opportunities, while others learn it for convenience. Despite its importance, computer science has many challenging aspects, such as keeping motivated, getting started, and resisting the temptation to write nonsense. Motivation is hard to find when it seems everyone is better and doing more than you. And the advice given for this was to focus on what you are doing, and you need to stay on your own path. Getting started could seem complicated because there may not be a structure, or you may be unable to find a solution. But you don’t need the plan to be rigid, and you can Google your question and get the knowledge of those who came before you. And finally, to keep yourself from writing nonsense, you must ensure that no corners are cut, and everything is followed correctly. Overall this panel was really informative and taught me how computer science applies in engineering and how to overcome common challenges many people have. .",

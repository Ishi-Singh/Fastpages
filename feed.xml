And if were to not test these features there would be a chance that I implement a feature that either breaks the website or doesn’t work which will lead to lower user satisfaction. In order to communicate with the DevOps I will message them daily about updates or things I need help with. I can also talk to them during class to keep them informed so they can help me as much as possible. And I will use frontend languages in making features more interactable for the user. Currently I’m using HTML to make the quiz, but the scripting for it will be done in JavaScript. And other QOL features will be done in HTML and CSS so the user can have a comfortable expirience when navigating the website.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">5.1 and 5.2 Hacks</title><link href="https://random-ign.github.io/Fastpages//Fastpages/markdown/2023/01/31/5.1-5.2-hacks.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="5.1 and 5.2 Hacks" /><published>2023-01-31T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-31T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://random-ign.github.io/Fastpages//Fastpages/markdown/2023/01/31/5.1-5.2-hacks</id><author><name></name></author><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[5.1 Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing Three benefits and corresponding harms of computing are: Increasing efficancy at the expense of human jobs since people will probably lose their jobs to AI and computers Access to more information at the expense of some people not having access to this information Allowing for communication at the expense of dividing the world since not all people will have access to this communication the digital divide whould just be enhanced]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Database/Model, Backend, OOP, Python</title><link href="https://random-ign.github.io/Fastpages//Fastpages/jupyter/2023/01/17/PBL-database.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Database/Model, Backend, OOP, Python" /><published>2023-01-17T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-17T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://random-ign.github.io/Fastpages//Fastpages/jupyter/2023/01/17/PBL-database</id><author><name></name></author><category term="jupyter" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The project-based learning objective is to create a purposeful backend, something that can't be done in frontend via JavaScript.

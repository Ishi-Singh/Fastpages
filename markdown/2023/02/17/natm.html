<p>The piece above was made by my friend and I find it interesting to look at since the colors go well together and the background looks really cool. This was done for AP Studio Art and there weren’t many other pieces which had animals. Out of both of these pieces my favorite was probably the parrot since it stood out from the background (since the bright blue and yellow were really saturated while the background was somewhat dull and gray) and it also had better details than the deer (even though the deer had spots on its back the wings of the parrot are more detailed and it looks really skillful). Not to mention the backgound was also better since it had more realistic textures which weren’t overpowering the center piece (the parrot).</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82348259/221680097-841c3b71-57c4-47a9-aa93-f4a01d5ea77c.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>I liked this second piece because of its simplistic nature and how it potrays peacefulness. I also liked the slightly monochromatic color palette especially since it adds to how the piece looks. I also have a personal bias towards this since I like the ocean and other large bodies of water and the water was drawn well in this. Even though there isn’t much going on in the overall piece the way all of the elements such as the boat, water, and mountain come together makes it look good and well coordinated.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82348259/221680130-027a02e5-1228-4f14-986a-b40809ea0d60.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>This piece is from ceramics and it’s a turtle, I really like how the colors look since they go well together, especially since all of the color isn’t blended out completely and has a marble effect. Not to mention the design is also really creative and overall the piece is really well made. This probably took a lot of effort to make since the handles had a braided texture and the turtle even had an expression. I also wonder why the person decided to make a turtle, I’ve heaerd theat turtles represent wealth and longevity. These are typically seen as prosperous traits which is really cool.</p>

<p>This is the final piece that I liked in N@tM and it’s a photograph, the main reason I like this is because of how saturated the colors are which makes them pop out and enhances the beauty of the piece. I also liked the right more since it has more contrast compared the the left one, and this contrast emphasizes certain details which adds to how the piece looks. I’m really interested in photography since it seems like a simple activity but actually requires a lot of skill (similar to other art mediums). Especially since there are many factors that go inot making a good photo such as the amount of exposure and the shutter speed. both of these pieces a really pretty and I hope that I’m able to take photos that look like this eventually.</p>

<p>In this project, we are making a reverse dictionary. We were inspired by many students’ studious and driven culture and wanted to create a site that could help them. A problem that we noticed among many students, especially those in advanced English courses, is that they often don’t know or can’t remember the word they want to use. Through the use of this website, we want to help these students allowing them to do well where ever they choose to use this website.</p>

<h2 id="row-2-data-abstraction">
<a class="anchor" href="#row-2-data-abstraction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Row 2: Data Abstraction</h2>

<p>We could either make a file which has a list of words and its synonyms or find an API which already does this.</p>

<h2 id="row-3-managing-complexity">
<a class="anchor" href="#row-3-managing-complexity" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Row 3: Managing Complexity</h2>

<p>We could simplify code by storing the synonyms in a list or dictionary, allowing for unnecessary code to be removed</p>

<h2 id="row-4-procedural-abstraction">
<a class="anchor" href="#row-4-procedural-abstraction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Row 4: Procedural Abstraction</h2>

<p>The word would be a user input which would then be compared with other words and then the words it matches would be outputed</p>

<h2 id="row-5-algorithm-implementation">
<a class="anchor" href="#row-5-algorithm-implementation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Row 5: Algorithm Implementation</h2>

<p>Loops can be used to repeate the process of finding words related to the inputed word until all of the words in the list are oub=putted</p>

<h2 id="row-6-testing">
<a class="anchor" href="#row-6-testing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Row 6: Testing</h2>

<p>The main thing that would need to be tested many times is the is the API but something that will be tested as well is the formatting and user input to see if both of them work well with the UI</p>
